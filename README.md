# Animated-chess

Animated chess is a game from the popular ‘Harry Potter’ book series, which follows all the regular rules of chess. In Animated chess, the chess pieces take the form of humanoid characters, and walk from square to square when moved. Also, if a piece ‘claims’ another piece from the board, an attack animation plays and the opposing piece is destroyed.

## Environment 

Our characters are placed in the outdoor green battle field where they fight one another with the wits of chess rule. Like any other chess game, there are two players (blue and white) in this Wizard Chess. 

Player (you) will assume the position of white. As always, white makes the first move.

## Board 

The board is built with the grid system and every grid (white or green square) has a column and row number assigned for the navigation of the chess piece movement and storing of the position of player’s chess piece. Note: The idea of the chess board grid is inspired by [Chess Game (with Unity) by Brian Broom] (https://www.kodeco.com/5441-how-to-make-a-chess-game-with-unity). 

## Piece Selection

When player hovers over the chess piece, it is highlighted with yellow square.
When player selects the chess piece, possible moves are shown with blue squares and possible captured moves are highlighted with red squares.
